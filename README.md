# WheelOfFortune
WheelOfFortune is a popular text game developed using python. 
Contestants compete to solve word puzzles, similar to those used in Hangman, 
to win cash and prizes. The wheel is automatically spun for the contestants 
throughout the course of the game to determine their cash and/or prizes. 
At the beginning of the game, the user is asked about how many human and 
computer players should play the game. The player can decide the difficulty 
level of the computer players. The aim is to guess the phrase or the next 
character correctly and win the rewards.
